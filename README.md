# Existence Reminder
 Originally created as a digital journal with a calendar interface, and now also supports color-coding.  Standalone applications included.
 Instructions for use: inside one of the application folders, insert txt files named as "year-month-day.txt" (ex. 2022-8-16 for August 16th, 2022.)  If the first line of the txt file is a float, it will be interpreted as a rating.  0 is red, 3 is green, and other numbers hue-shift the color accordingly.
 The calendar can be navigated by left- or right-clicking, scrolling months forward and backward respectively.  Clicking on a day will show its txt file, and this can be exited by pressing Esc.
